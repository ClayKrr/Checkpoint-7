# Checkpoint-7
I'm more than honored to present my seventh checkpoint.
Shopping cart:
In this Repositorie I created an eCommerce website based on shopping cart manipulation which is an essential part of a retailer's online store that streamlines the online shopping experience. It's a software that allows website visitors to select, reserve, and purchase a product or service from an eCommerce interface.

-in the first example I have followed these Instructions:
1. Adjust the quantity of each item through  “+” and “-” buttons.
2. Delete items from the cart.
3. Like items through a clickable heart-shaped button that will redirect you to a wishlist (in build) page.
4. See the total price adjusted according to quantity and deletions.
5. Checkout button that will direct you to a paypal pay sandbox.

-in the second example I have tried another concept which fly the items to the cart
and then you can click the shopping cart icon in order to show the items inside.

ENJOY,
